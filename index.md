### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, (part - 1) was one of my favorite labs this semester because this was
    my first time ever coding as I had no prior knowledge of the computer
    science field. I was very happy to see that this is a start to something
    big in my career. In this lab I learned how to display an output to the
    screen as Hello World!

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, (part - 2) was one of my favorite labs this semester because in this
    lab I had to write code that uses if statements which I found very intersting.
    I was happy to see that I was able to write code for the game blackjack. In this
    part I learned how to write if statements as I found it a little challenging,
    but I found this lab one of my favorites.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, (part - 1) and (part - 2) was my favorite lab that I worked on out of
    all the other labs this semester. I really enjoyed this lab because I feel like
    this lab was the most challenging one out of all the other labs. In this lab we
    used random numbers and I was working with images. I created a GIF which was 
    honestly so intersting to make and this lab taught me the purpose of generating
    random numbers. I will display a GIF created by this lab below!
